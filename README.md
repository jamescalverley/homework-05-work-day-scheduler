## Homework-05 Work Day Scheduler

A simple work day scheduler to save and schedule events throughout the day. 

### Project Description

This project introduced a new library, Moment.js. This library was utiltized to add a current time to the app and then use that time to compare to the time in each hour block. 

The other main component of this project was saving to local storage and then retrieving any stored information when the page reloaded. The schedule object containing the data for all the events was saved to local storage using JSON.stringify() and then retrieved using JSON.parse().
